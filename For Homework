#I made the value 'average' to store the sum of scores for a later use.
average = 0.0
#This part loops the code 5 times to get 5 scores from the user
for i in range(5):
    #here we sk the user to enter a score and convert it to a float
    score = float(input("Enter a score: "))
    #then the code adds the entered score to the running total
    average += score  
#we follow that by dividing the total by 5 to get the average
average = average / 5
#now we jsut print the calculated average
print("The average score is:", average)
